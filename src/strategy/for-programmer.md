### ***ugly way***
There are few of functions which is not given in properate way, even kind of ugly way. 

So i annotate them by: `// >< #ugly way.` *Have to modify them into a elegant way*

### ***version***
 I use the `[alpha/beta]` to mark those functional modules which are in development.

### ***About the naming rules of variables..***
Till now, sorry, i have no idea of how to name a variables according to some specific consistent rule.
